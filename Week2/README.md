## 1. Tell us a bit about the organism.

Spoon-billed sandpiper
The **spoon-billed sandpiper** (Calidris pygmaea) is a small wader which breeds on the coasts of the Bering Sea and winters in Southeast Asia. his species is highly threatened, and it is said that since the 1970s the breeding population has decreased significantly. By 2000, the estimated breeding population of the species was 350â€“500

## 2. How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? Does that match with the expectation for this organism?

## 3. How many features does the file contain?

## 4. How many genes are listed for this organism?

## 5. Is there a feature type that you may have not heard about before? What is the feature and how is it defined? (If there is no such feature, pick a common feature.)

## 6. What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?

## 7. Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?

## 8. Share any other insights you might note.
